		<h2 id="Welcome">Welcome</h2>
		<p>My name is Rhea Patney. I'm from Missouri and have lived there all of my life. I love to play sports and be active. I especially love two sports in particular and those are basketball and taekwondo. I play basketball for two teams. A select team called the <strong>St. Louis Rockets</strong> and for my school team. I do taekwondo at an organization called <strong>ATA Martial Arts</strong> and I am a first degree black belt. I also love spending time with my family, including my younger brother, and spending time with my friends. I also love music. I've played the piano for 8 years and I play the flute with my school band. Thanks for checking out my website</p>
